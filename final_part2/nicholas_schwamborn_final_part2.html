    <h1>Course Review Questions</h1>
    <strong>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</strong>
    <p>Prior to this course, I did not have any knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript, but I did know java which made it easier to understand formatting and the process.</p>
    <strong>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</strong>
    <p>I used the template provided for my portfolio, but I changed the key details of it such as the background and text design to add more originality to it.</p>
    <strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</strong>
    <p>Honestly, the hardest part of the portfolio was making sure the images of the artifacts are correctly spaced and lined up with their descriptions.</p>
    <strong>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </strong>
    <p>This class made me realize how much effort and knowledge is truly needed behind the scenes to create a well-made and functionable website.</p>
    <strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong>
    <p>This is definitely a class I would recommend for students to take to improve their general knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
